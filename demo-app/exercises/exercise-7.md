# Exercise 7

1. Create a new component named Car Edit Row. Car Edit Row is the same as Car View Row, except the columns for make, model, year, color and price are input fields.

Populate the edit row input fields with the data for the car when the row is displayed.

Note: the `[formGroup]` does not have to be applied to a `<form>` element. It can be applied to any element.

2. In the last column of Car Edit Row, display (but do not implement) two buttons: "Save"  and "Cancel".

3. In the Car View Row, add an "Edit" button to the actions column. When the button is clicked, that one car data row changes from a Car View Row component to a Car Edit Row component. Only ONE row is editable at a time. Design your data structures accordingly. Do not support/enable multiple edit rows in your data structure.

4. Ensure it works.
